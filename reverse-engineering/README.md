# Reverse Engineering 

Reverse Engineering **examines an executable file** for information about implementation and design. 
Attackers use this technique to **find potential vulnerabilities** in a software project.

There are two ways of reverse engineering:
* The **static analysis** will examine the binary file without starting the program. 
  In addition to the stored data, the control flows of the implementation are particularly interesting.
  
* The **dynamic analysis** explores the running program. 
  Here, the interactions with its environment and the data flows inside the software system are in the foreground.

## Examples

* **Static Analysis**

* **Dynamic Analysis**
  * [file-access](https://github.com/teiniker/teiniker-lectures-securitytesting/tree/main/reverse-engineering/c-file-access)
  * [database-calls](https://github.com/teiniker/teiniker-lectures-securitytesting/tree/main/reverse-engineering/c-database-access)

## Tools Setup 
Many reverse engineering tools are supplied with regular Linux distributions, others have to be installed later.

* [Ghidra](https://github.com/teiniker/teiniker-lectures-securitytesting/tree/main/reverse-engineering/setup/Ghidra.md)
