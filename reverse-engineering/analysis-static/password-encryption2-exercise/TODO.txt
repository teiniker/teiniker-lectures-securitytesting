Exercise: Reverse Engineering - Password Check with Encryption 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Given the executable named "password_check".

$ ./password_check 
password> student
Login rejected, invalid password!

A) Hardcoded password  
Use static reverse engineering techniques to extract the hardcoded password.

hardcoded password: TODO


B) Decrypt password 
Find out how the password will be encrypted and decrypt the found password.
For the process of decryption, extend the "decrypt_password.py" file, so that
the plaintext password will be printed out.

plaintext password: TODO
