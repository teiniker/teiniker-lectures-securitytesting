#Penetration testing

Penetration testing, also referred to as **ethical hacking**, is the process of testing a system for vulnerabilities that an attacker could exploit.

The goal of penetration testing is to **find the holes in our security** so that we can fix them before attackers discover them.

The following areas of penetration testing will be covered:

* Embedded Web Applications
  * HTTP Protocol
  * Web Clients
  * Access Control
  * Attacking Browsers

* C Applications
