# Penetration Testing

Pen testing, also referred to as **ethical hacking**, is the process of testing a system for vulnerabilities that an attacker could exploit.

The goal of penetration testing is to **find the holes in our security** so that we can fix them before attackers discover them.

The following areas of penetration testing will be covered in the context of **embedded web applications**:

* **Tool Setup**

  * [ZAP](https://github.com/teiniker/teiniker-lectures-securitytesting/tree/main/penetration-testing/setup/ZAP)


* [**HTTP/S Protocol**](https://github.com/teiniker/teiniker-lectures-securitytesting/tree/main/penetration-testing/http-protocol)


* [**C Applications**](https://github.com/teiniker/teiniker-lectures-securitytesting/tree/main/penetration-testing/c-applications/)
