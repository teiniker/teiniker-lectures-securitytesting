# Penetration Testing

Pen testing, also referred to as **ethical hacking**, is the process of testing a system for vulnerabilities that an attacker could exploit.

The goal of penetration testing is to **find the holes in our security** so that we can fix them before attackers discover them.

The following areas of penetration testing will be covered in the context of **embedded web applications**:


* **API Security Basics**
  * [HTTP/S Protocol](api-security/http-protocol)
  * [API Best Practices](api-security/api-bestpractices/)
  * [Access Control](api-security/access-control)
    * Authentication
    * Authorization
