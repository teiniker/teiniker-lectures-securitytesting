Path-Traversal Attack
---------------------------------------------------------------------
A path traversal attack, also known as directory traversal, is a type 
of security vulnerability that occurs when an application allows input 
to influence file paths used by the system. In such an attack, the 
attacker exploits inadequate security controls to access or manipulate 
files located outside of the intended directory.
