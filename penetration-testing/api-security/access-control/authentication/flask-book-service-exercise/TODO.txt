Exercise: API Security - TLS, Basic Authentication, Test Client
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Given a working REST service (see README.md to run and test the service via curl).

Improve the Security of the REST service:

A) Add TLS support
Configure the service to handle only requests send via HTTPS.

B) Add HTTP Basic Authentication 
Extend the service to force clients to authenticate themselfs.
Use the following credentials:
    bart / eatmyshorts
    homer / duffbeer
Also, change the curl statements so that you can test the service again.

C) Test Client using requests library 
Implement a test class named "BookServiceTest" which uses the "requests" 
library to run the curl tests in an automated way.
