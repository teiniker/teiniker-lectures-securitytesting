# Object-Level Authorization

Object-level authorization refers to a security mechanism where **access control 
is applied at the level of individual objects** of resources. This means that the 
system checks whether a user has permission to perform a specific action (like read, 
update, delete) on a particular object (like a database record, file, or data entry).

One way to implement object-level authorization is to use Universally Unique 
Identifiers (UUID). 
When using UUIDs for identifiers we cannot infer from one ID to another ID.

In Python we can use the method `uuid.uuid4()` from the module `uuid`  which is part 
of the Python Standard Library.
The UUID generated by `uuid4()` is based on random numbers and is considered 
cryptographically secure.

To convert a UUID into a string representation, we can use `str(uuid.uuid4())`.


## Setup 

We start the web service from the command line:
```
$ python3 article_service.py
```


## Access REST Service via cURL

Note that the used UUIDs in the following examples are randomly generated and
will differ from the ones shown here.
