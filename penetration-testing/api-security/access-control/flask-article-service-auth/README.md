# Basic Authentication

In this example, we can see how simple a RESTful service can be implemented with
**Flask**.

## Setup 
```
$ pip3 install Flask-HTTPAuth
```

We start the web service from the command line:
```
$ python3 article_service.py
```

## Flask-HTTPAuth

Flask-HTTPAuth is a Flask extension that simplifies the use of HTTP authentication with Flask routes.

The function decorated with the `verify_password` decorator receives the username and password sent by the client. If the credentials belong to a user, then the function should return the user object. If the credentials are invalid the function can return `None` or `False`. The user object can then be queried from the `current_user()` method of the authentication instance.
