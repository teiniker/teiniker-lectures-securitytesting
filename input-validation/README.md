# Input Validation

> **Input validation** is the process of verifying and ensuring that the data 
> provided by a user or an external system adheres to expected formats, types, 
> or constraints before being processed by an application. 

It is a crucial aspect of **application security** and functionality, protecting 
the system from invalid, malicious, or unintended inputs that could lead to:
* SQL Injection
* Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
* Command Injection
* ...

## Techniques for Input Validation

### Type Checking

### Boundary Checking


### Regular Expressions (RegEx):

* Normalization

* Whitelisting

* Blacklisting
