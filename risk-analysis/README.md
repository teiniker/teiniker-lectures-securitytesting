# Knowledge for Software Security

Critical software security knowledge and expertise can be compiled:

* [OWASP IoT Top 10](OWASP-IoT-Top10.md)

* [OWASP Top 10](OWASP-Top10.md)

* [CWE/SANS Top 25](CWE-TOP25.md)

These lists are a **tool for education and awareness** to help programmers to prevent 
the kinds of vulnerabilities by identifying and avoiding all-too-common mistakes 
that occur before software is even shipped.
