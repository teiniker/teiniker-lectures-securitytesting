Exercise: Password Storage with Salt and Iteratiosn (Message Digest)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You should implement a class called "PasswordEncryption" which encrypts
and verifies passwords. A SHA-256 hash algorithm together with a 16 bytes
random salt and iterations should be used.

The class should provide (at least) the following methods:
1. encrypt(self, plaintext_password, iterations)
    A random salt (16 bytes) should be generated.
    Salt and password (as bytes) should be concatenated 
    Salt and password will be hashed "iteration" times
    Salt and hashed password should be concatenated and returned as bytes

2. verify(self, plaintext_password, encrypted_password, iterations)
    Extract the salt (16 bytes) from the given encrypted_password
    Use the salt, the plaintext_password, and the iteration count to encrypt the password
    Compare the encrypted password with the given encrypted_password

Use the "PasswordEncryptionTest" class to verify your implementations.
