Exercise: Password Storage with Salt (Message Digest)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You should implement a class called "PasswordEncryption" which encrypts
and verifies passwords. A SHA-256 hash algorithm together with a 16 bytes
random salt should be used.

The class should provide (at least) the following methods:
1. encrypt(self, plaintext_password)
    A random salt (16 bytes) should be generated.
    Salt and password (as bytes) should be concatenated and hashed
    Salt and hashed password should be concatenated and returned as bytes

2. verify(self, plaintext_password, encrypted_password)
    Extract the salt (16 bytes) from the given encrypted_password
    Use the salt and the plaintext_password to encrypt the password
    Compare the encrypted password with the given encrypted_password

Tips:
- You can concatenate byte arrays using the + operator
