in the constructor and provides the following methods:

A) from_bytes(self, data:bytes)->str
   Calculate a HMAC based on (SHA-256) from a given binary array "data"

B) from_string(self, text:str)->str
   Calculate a HMAC based on (SHA-256) from a given string "text"

C) from_file(self, filename:str)->str
   Calculate a HMAC based on (SHA-256) from a given file with the name
   "filename" read from the filesystem.
   Read the file as a binary 'rb'.
