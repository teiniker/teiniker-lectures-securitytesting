Exercise: File Encrypter (Symmetric Encryption) 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Implement a class called "FileEncrypter" with the following operations:

A) __init__(self, key:bytes, iv:bytes)->None
   A constructor that takes a secret key and an initialization vector (iv) to setup
   an AES cipher in CTR mode.

B) save(self, filename:str, data:bytearray)->None
   Encrypt the given data with the AES cipher.
   Store the ciphertext in a binary file with the given "filename".

C) load(self, filename:str)->bytes
   Load the content of a binary file with the given "filename".
   Decrypt the loaded bytes with the AES cipher and return the plaintext data.

Verify your implementations with the FileEncryptorTest class.
