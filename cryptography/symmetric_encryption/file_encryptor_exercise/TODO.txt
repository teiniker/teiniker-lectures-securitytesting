Exercise: File Encrypter (Symmetric Encryption) 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Implement a class called "FileEncrypter" with the following operations:

A) __init__(self, key, iv)
   A constructor that takes a secret key and an initialization vector (iv) to setup
   an AES cipher in CTR mode.

B) save(self, filename, data)
   Encrypt the given data with the AES cipher.
   Store the ciphertext in a binary file with the given "filename".

C) load(self, filename)
   Load the content of a binary file with the given "filename".
   Decrypt the loaded bytes with the AES cipher and return the plaintext data.

Verify your implementations with the FileEncryptorTest class.
