Exercise: Symmetric Encryption + Key Derivation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Implement a class called "FileEncrypter" with the following operations:

A) __init__(self, password, salt, iv) 
   A constructor that takes a password and a salt and uses a key derivation 
   function to generate a secret key: 
       PBKDF2HMAC:
        hashes.SHA256()
        length=32,
        iterations=100000 

    The secret key and the given initialization vector (iv) are used to setup
    an AES cipher in CTR mode.

B) save(self, filename, data) 
   Encrypt the given data with the AES cipher.
   Store the ciphertext in a binary file with the given "filename".

C) load(self, filename) 
   Load the content of a binary file with the given "filename".
   Decrypt the loaded bytes with the AES cipher and return the plaintext data.

Verify your implementations with the given "FileEncryptorTest" class.
